## Description

A reading group organised by the [Data Science group](http://www.lse.ac.uk/Statistics/Research/Data-Science) of LSE [Department of Statistics](http://www.lse.ac.uk/Statistics). Topics involve Machine Learning techniques with a focus on the main ideas from a theoretical point of view without necessarily excluding applications of the method. See [here](https://lse-ml.github.io) for last year's reading group.

## Membership

The group us currently open to all members of the Department of Statistics. If you want to stop receiving emails about it contact Kayleigh Brewer.

## Meeting schedule

### Michaelmans Term

The reading group sessions take place every second **Monday, 13:00-14:00**, Leverhulme library, Department of Statistics, 6th Floor, Columbia House. **Lunch** will be available from **12:30**.

| 14th Oct, 2019         |  [A Theoretical Analysis of Deep Q-Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.00137),<br/> Yang, Xie and Wang, 2019 | Chengchun Shi, LSE   |
| 28th Oct, 2019        |  [Kernel and Mean Embedding of Distributions: A Review and Beyond](https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.09522),<br/> Muandet, Fukumizu, Sriperumbudur and Schölkopf, 2017 <details> I will give an introduction intended for a wider audience to reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHSs) and the application to kernel mean embeddings of probability distributions, loosely based on the above paper. As an application, I will show how kernel mean embeddings can be used to define dependence measures, and also outline the limitations of this approach. I will argue that RKHSs have a fundamental role to play in statistical science, i.e., that they are more than just another tool. </details>                                                        | Wicher Bergsma, LSE |

| 9th Dec, 2019       |  Towards a statistical foundation of deep learning <details> Recently a lot of progress has been made in the theoretical understanding of deep learning. One of the very promising directions is the statistical approach, which interprets deep learning as a statistical method and builds on existing techniques in mathematical statistics to derive theoretical error bounds. The talk surveys this field and describes future challenges. </details>      |  [Johannes Schmidt-Hieber](https://wwwhome.ewi.utwente.nl/~schmidtaj/index.html), University of Twente    |
